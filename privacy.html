                    <header><h1>privacy</h1></header>
                    <p> Dash Technologies, Inc., doing business as Dash ("Dash," "we," "us," "our"), knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.</p>
                    <p>Dash is a data-conscious organization, and our only goal is to benefit the learning environment. Dash will never release any type of information to any third party without your permission.</p>
                    <p>Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy ("Policy"). By visiting our website at www.techbydash.com or any of our other websites, applications, domain names or other linked pages (collectively the "Website"), or using any of our online services (together with the Website, the "Online Services"), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Policy, and you agree to allow us to collect, use, store, and share your information, including any information you provide about your students (collectively, "your information" or "your personal information"), as described in this Policy.</p>
                    <p>Your personal information we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of your home country. It may also be processed by staff operating outside of your home country who work for us or one of our suppliers or partners. By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that any of your personal information that you submit is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy, as set out in more detail in Section 6. If you do not wish to agree to these terms, please do not provide your information when requested and immediately stop using our Online Services. Your use of certain Dash Online Services may also be subject to "terms of use" or "software license" agreements, which are separate from this Policy. Nothing in this Policy shall be construed to limit Dash's rights and remedies under any such separate agreements. However, the student data you enter will not be viewed by any staff inside or outside of your home country. All student data is encrypted and can only be accessed by the person that uploads such information and/or the account holder.</p>
                    <p>Because our online data collection activities are primarily targeted to educators, the practices and terms set forth in this Policy are mostly relevant and addressed to "you" as an educator. Therefore, all references to "you" or "your" refer to adult users, unless specifically noted otherwise. We have also developed a separate specific set of practices for the handling of any personal information we collect online about children. These are outlined in Section 7 below. </p><br />
                    <p>As an educator you have access to personally identifiable information from your students and it is your responsibility to comply with any privacy policies maintained by your employer, school, or institution regarding any of your information that you may choose to share with us. Dash disclaims any liability for any breach of privacy under the terms of any privacy agreement that you, your employer, or your institution may have with your students, their parents, or their guardians.</p><br />
				<h4>1.	What does this Policy cover?</h4>
                    <p>This Policy explains how Dash collects and uses information from its users who access the Website and use our Online Services, including our treatment of personally identifiable information.  This policy does not apply to websites or practices of companies that Dash does not own or control, or to individuals that Dash does not employ or manage. The Policy covers the Online Services operated by Dash, including access to the Website through third party applications that use Dash's Software Development Kit.</p>
                    <p><ul><li>This Policy does not apply to any of the following:</li>
                    <li>(a)   Information collected by Dash through offline means (such as through a mail-in product registration card or on the phone by Dash Customer Support), unless we clearly note otherwise at the place or time of data collection or the offline-collected data is merged and used together with online-collected data;</li>
                    <li>(b)  Websites operated by other companies that we link to from our Online Services, or that provide links from their sites to ours. We are not responsible, and disclaim any and all responsibility, for the practices or content of such third party websites; or,</li>
                    <li>(c)   Information given to us in a business capacity or for employment or work related purposes, such as information about our business customers (retailers, distributors, etc.), personal information provided by artists or other professionals we hire to help create our products, or job applicant data submitted through the Careers section of a Dash website.</li></ul></p><br />
                    <h4>2.	What information do we collect?</h4>
                    <p>The information we collect through our Online Services will generally fall into one of the following categories (please carefully read and understand the definitions of the terms below, as these terms may be used repeatedly throughout the rest of this Policy):</p>
                    <p><ul><li>Information you voluntarily provide us:</li>
                    <li>•	Personal Information (PI) such as your first name, last name, telephone numbers, e-mail address or other information that allows us to directly or indirectly personally identify or contact you online or off. The contact information described above may be requested about your students or your students' guardians (e.g., name, phone number.), instead of or in addition to you personally. No personal information is ever solicited or collected directly from children (for more information about our practices regarding children, please see Section 7 below).</li>
                    <li>•	Login Information such as username and password, secret answers to certain security questions, or other similar information that allows us to uniquely identify your account or authenticate you prior to giving you access to your account information or certain online activities. For some online accounts (such as a Dash account created on the Dash for Teachers app or Dash.com, certain login information such as your username may, itself, be personal (like an e-mail address) or tied to other personal information.</li>
                    <li>•	Demographic Information which may include the following types of information about you and/or your students: age or date of birth, grades taught or grade level, highest level of education or graduation date, gender, products owned or of interest, favorite subjects and characters, languages spoken, involvement in school programs, and other non-personal or survey-type information including hobbies, attitudes, interests, and skills. Again, this type of information is only collected directly from adults (parents or educators) and, as mentioned above, pertains to themselves and/or their children. In some instances demographic information may be combined and stored together with your personal information.</li></ul></p>
                    <p><ul><li>Information passively or automatically collected:</li>
                    <li>•	Technical Information, which may include certain information or characteristics about your tablet, computer, or smartphone. Specific examples include the type of operating system and web browser you use, your device's Internet Protocol (IP) Address, the names and versions of programs installed on your device, and information about the device itself, including product unique identifier, applications or software titles stored on the device, and product license information (i.e., information about the person or system licensed/authorized to use the product and/or its supporting software applications). For the most part, technical information such as the types described above remains anonymous (i.e., does not identify you personally), but in some cases can be traced back to personal information such as an e-mail address.</li></ul></p><br />
                    <h4>3.	How much information do we collect and when do we collect it?</h4>
                    <p>The specific types and amounts of information we collect from adults from the categories above will vary depending on your level of interaction with our Online Services, but, as a general rule, will be relevant and proportionate to the service being requested or used. We may however automatically capture certain technical information and browsing data about your visit to a Dash website or Online Service (such as the browser type you used, which web pages you visited, and how much time you spent on pages visited). (For more on passive or automatic data collection, please see Section 4 on cookies and other web technologies.) If you voluntarily choose to engage in a more active way with a Dash Online Service such as by doing anything from the list below, we may request or require that you provide us certain personal and/or demographic information.
                    <ul><li>(a)   Register or create an online Dash educator account (both of which may be referred to in this Policy as a "Dash account" or "your account")</li>
                    <li>(b)  Purchase or download products, software, or other services</li>
                    <li>(c)   Sign-up for newsletters, product announcements, marketing or other communications</li>
                    <li>(d)  Use community features such as our blogs and forums or social areas </li>
                    <li>(e)   Contact or communicate with Dash Customer Support</li>
                    <li>(f)   Participate in online surveys, studies, polls or other market research (such as educator panels)</li>
                    <li>(g)  Provide your children with curated videos</li>
                    <li>(h)  Sign-up and participate in focus groups or product testing such as through Dash Labs</li>
                    <li>(i)    Submit testimonials, success stories, or product ideas</li></ul></p>
                    <p>Please note that depending on the specific Dash Online Service you are using, some, many, or all of the activities listed above may not be available. When these features are available and if you choose to use them, some of the activities may require that you first register or create a general Dash account on the specific Online Service you are visiting/using. To do this, you may be asked to establish unique login information, in addition to providing personal and/or demographic information.</p>
                    <p><ul><li>Consequences for not providing certain information:</li>
                    <li>If you choose not to provide personal or demographic information when requested, your experience using our Online Services may be significantly limited. For example, without submitting personal information, you will not be able to buy products on our Websites or register to stay updated on Dash's newest products or special offers.</li></ul></p>
                    <p><ul><li>Email and Text Message Communications:</li>
                    <li>If you provide us your email address or phone number, we may send you email or text message communications. By maintaining an account with Dash and/or by failing to opt out of the receipt of information hereunder, you acknowledge that you may receive e-mail or text messages on your phone or mobile communications device, and that the receipt of such messages may cause you to incur usage charges or other fees or costs in accordance with your wireless or data service plan. Any and all such charges, fees, or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees, or costs may apply. We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Dash if your computer supports this type of program. Dash uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful.</li></ul></p><br />
                    <h4>4.	Cookies and other web technologies</h4>
                    <p>Dash may use a variety of standard technologies to: (i) enhance and personalize your experience while using our Online Services (including saving you the time of having to repeatedly re-enter information); (ii) generate statistics and information about traffic to and usage of our Online Services; and (iii) advise you of Dash products, services, and/or special offers which may be of interest to you; and, (iv) run and measure the effectiveness of certain advertising or promotional campaigns, including those run by network advertisers on our behalf. These tools may include the following:
                    <p>(a)   Cookies – these are small text files that we may store on your computer to remember certain things about your visit to or use of our Online Services. For example, cookies might be used for any of the following: (i) remembering the content you previously viewed on a Dash website, your online order history, items you placed in a wish list or shopping cart, or the nickname or device profile name you created when registering on one of our websites or web-connected software applications; (ii) keeping track of your children favorite games and activities, and any points or rewards they generate when playing them; (iii) for security purposes, such as to lock out underage users from certain activities or services; (iv) remembering or storing certain personal information (such as the username/email address you use to login to your Dash account) so we can save you the time of having to re-enter this information, or re-market to you products in which you have previously shown interest; and/or (v) linking information contained in a cookie to personal information collected from you by other means (such as through account registration).</p>
                    <p>Most common web browsers today allow you to modify your settings to block cookies entirely, alert you every time they are being sent, or allow their use by only those websites you approve. You can also delete cookies that are currently stored on your computer's hard drive. To do this, look for the Cookie control settings in your web browser (usually under Tools, Options/Internet Options, Privacy/Security tab) and then make your desired selections. If you choose to disable cookies, certain features of our Online Services may not be available or work properly and you may inadvertently delete the cookie that enables you to opt-out of ads served by network advertisers on our behalf (see below for more information).</p>
                    <p>(b)  Log Files – these are files that record web activity and gather non-personal statistics about your visit to or use of a Dash Online Service. Log files may help us capture, among other things: (i) your IP Address, which is a unique set of numbers assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) (note that, depending on your ISP, the number assigned to your computer can be different every time you connect to the Internet); (ii) the type of browser and operating system you use; and, (iii) other information about your online session, such as the URL you came from to get to our website and the date and time you visited our website or used our Online Service. In addition to using this information to better understand how our Online Services are used, we may use information captured through log files such as an IP Address (together with your personal information) to troubleshoot technical problems, maintain online safety and security, and if necessary, prohibit or restrict access to our Online Services by certain users.</p>
                    <p>(c)   Web beacons – We may deliver a file to you through the Website (known as a "web beacon") from an ad network.  Web beacons are small electronic image files that can be embedded within a web page or included in an e-mail message, and are usually invisible to the human eye. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers.  Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites.  Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p><br />
                    <h4>5.	How do we protect your personal information?</h4>
                    <p>Dash uses a variety of organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to help protect the security of your personal information (i.e., to prevent it from being lost, destroyed, stolen, misused, or accessed by an unauthorized person). These measures include, but are not limited to:</p>
                    <p><ul><li>(a)   Storing your personal information in secure operating environments that are only accessible to authorized Dash employees on a strict need-to-know basis; and,</li>
                    <li>(b)  Requiring our online users to verify their identities with unique login information before they can access or modify their Dash account information or settings.</li>
                    <li>(c)  Setting mobile application default to require log-in upon launch. </li></ul></p>
                    <p><ul><li>How you can help protect your information:</li>
                    <li>You can also play a role in helping keep your personal information safe. If you are required to create a unique password to restrict access to your account, choose a password that is hard for others to guess (one that has a combination of letters, symbols, or numbers), and be sure never to reveal it to anyone else. It is your responsibility to keep your password and account information confidential at all times. If you use a shared or public computer, never choose to have your login information remembered and make sure to log out of your account every time you leave the computer. If you are an educator, you should avoid saving or downloading any progress information onto shared or public computers.</li></ul></p>
                    <p>It is your responsibility to keep your Dash account information (including your email address) current and accurate, and to notify us if your email account ever changes or is terminated. Dash assumes no responsibility for misdirected messages (i.e., messages sent to an email account which you no longer own). Misdirected messages could reveal personal information about you (or the children profiles under your account) to unintended third parties.</p>
                    <p>If you own a Dash enabled product, the product may be designed to store certain information on the physical device itself (for example, a child's first name and/or product usage and demographic data). For your protection, before selling or otherwise transferring ownership of your Dash product, please be sure to clean off and securely remove all information from the device itself, including any play data. One way you could do this is by deleting the device from the account page which you can access on the device. In most cases, this will automatically erase the information stored on the product device. For additional help, please contact Customer Service using the information provided at the top of this Policy.</p><br />
                    <h4>6.	WHAT INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?</h4>
                    <p>Dash allows you to access the following information about you for the purpose of viewing, and in certain situations, updating that information. This list may change as the Website changes. You may currently access the following information, if your User Category allows you to input any of the following:</p>
                    <p><ul><li>-	information in your user account, </li>
                    <li>-	user contacts, </li>
                    <li>-	user preferences, and </li>
                    <li>-	content in your account. </li></ul></p>
                    <p><ul><li>What personal information can you access?</li>
                    <li>Through your account settings, you can view and update your account information, unsubscribe from Dash marketing communications (assuming you have already opted in to receiving these), or modify other preferences and settings. These areas are usually marked clearly on our website or Online Service (for example, they may be labeled as "My Account," "Your Account," "Edit Profile," "Settings," or other similar names), and may offer a variety of options that allow you to update information we've stored about you or any children profiles under your account, delete accounts or profiles, or otherwise maintain control over how your information is collected, stored, used, or shared by Dash. If these options are not available on our website or Online Service you are using, or you wish to make a request or modification different from what is offered or allowed within these account management areas, the following additional options are available to you:</li></ul></p>
                    <p>(a)   Customer Service – For additional help, you can always contact Customer Support using the information provided at the top of this Policy.</p>
                    <p>(b)   The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Website changes.  If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at support@dash.com.</p><br />
                    <h4>7.	How do we handle personal information related to children?</h4>
                  <p>Dash recognizes the importance of protecting children. For this reason, we will not knowingly collect or solicit any personal information directly from anyone under the age of 16.</p>
                    <p>(a)  We will only collect children's personal information from adults. Dash's online data collection activities are primarily targeted educators and parents, and thus we do not collect personal information (defined above) from users that we know to be children. If we seek to have personal information about children, we will always request this information directly from an educator, or other adult (but not the child) and on a portion of our website or Online Service intended only for such adults. In addition, any children's information is stored as part of the corresponding adult's Dash account (not a child's account), and can only be accessed by the adult account owner.</p>
                    <p>(b)    We handle children's personal information according to this Policy. Unless noted differently in this Section 7 or elsewhere in this Policy, any personal information collected from children will be used, protected, and disclosed in accordance with the other terms of this Policy (as set forth in detail in Sections 1–7 above). Dash does not share any personal information about children with third party companies unless parental consent has been obtained in advance.</p><br />
                    <h4>8.	Changes to this Policy</h4>
                    <p>We may amend this Policy from time to time.  Use of information we collect now is subject to the Policy in effect at the time such information is used.  If we make changes in the way we use personal information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Website or sending you an email. You are bound by any changes to the Policy when you use the Website after such changes have been first posted</p><br />
                    <h4>9.	Questions or Concerns</h4>
                    <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to support@dash.com.  We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.</p>
